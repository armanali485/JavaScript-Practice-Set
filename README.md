## Introduction
This project consists of a series of JavaScript exercises aimed at enhancing problem-solving skills and reinforcing important concepts such as functions, arrays, loops, DOM manipulation, and more. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refresh your knowledge, these problems offer hands-on practice to build solid JavaScript fundamentals.

## Prerequisites
Before diving into the practice set, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (for running JavaScript outside of a browser)
- A modern **web browser** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
- A code editor like **VSCode**, **Sublime Text**, or **Atom**

Basic understanding of:
- HTML and CSS (for DOM-related tasks)
- JavaScript fundamentals (variables, loops, functions, objects, etc.)

## How to Use

1. **Clone this repository**:  
   ```
   https://github.com/armanali485/JavaScript-Practice-Set.git
   cd JavaScript-Practice-Set
   ```

2. **Open the project** in your code editor and browser.

3. **Work on each problem**:
   - Each JavaScript file corresponds to a specific problem in the practice set.
   - Write your solution inside the appropriate `.js` file.
   - Use `console.log()` statements to test your solutions, or work with an HTML file to test DOM-related tasks.

4. **Run the code**:
   - For browser-related tasks, open the HTML file in your browser.
   - For pure JavaScript problems, you can run them directly in your terminal using Node.js:
     ```
     node 1.js
     ```

5. **Check your progress** by comparing your solutions with the expected output.
